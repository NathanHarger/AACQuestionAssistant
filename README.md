# AACQuestionAssistant
AACQuestion Assistant is a Augmented Alternative Communication device that assists speech therapists or paraeducators in asking questions to people with speech limitations. 
The [Mulberry Symbol](https://mulberrysymbols.org/) is used inside a grid of cards that are easily selected by people with varying abilities.
The vocab is spoken when tapped. 

Cards are populated by searching and picking a vocab image from the Mulberry Symbol set. 
Custom vocab can be created using images from the phone's gallery or taken from the camera. Custom pronunciation can be set for new vocab
ensuring names and words are pronounced correctily.
